      # **Hot, Cold and Intermittent Perforators**


      **Hot Perforators**


      Our Hot Perforators have solid state heater controls with both
      internal and external heated pin rollers. Other features are a timer
      for automatic warm up, automatic speed control which matches the web
      speed to produce round holes, automatic cool down, fully guarded
      interlocks with emergency stop, heat shield for web protection, a
      remote station to stop and start production and pin segments which are
      easily interchangeable for different perforation patterns. The
      diameter of the holes can also be adjusted with the needle depth
      adjusters. The Hot Perforator can easily be installed on to
      slitter/rewind units, bag machines etc.

      with a working width of up to 2 metres and production speeds of up to
      200 metres per minute


      Key Benefits:


      * Print register- This perforator can perforate to a print register
      mark

      * Pre set lengths - Can perforate to preset lengths, which can be set

      * Solid state heater controls- Both internal and externally heated pin
      roller ( for increased production speed)

      * Timer- Timer for automatic warm up ( no waiting time for heater to
      warm up)

      * Automatic speed control- Perforator automatically matches web speed
      to produce round holes.
